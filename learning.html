    <h2>Common Terms and Concepts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Stock: A type of security that represents ownership in a company. When you own a stock, you own a portion of the company's assets and earnings.        </li>
        <li>Bond: A debt investment where an investor loans money to an entity (typically a corporation or government) for a defined period at a fixed interest rate.        </li>
        <li>Mutual Fund: An investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets.        </li>
        <li>ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund): Similar to a mutual fund, an ETF is a collection of securities that often tracks an underlying index, but it trades on an exchange like a stock.        </li>
        <li>Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes (like stocks, bonds, and real estate) to reduce risk. The idea is that if one investment performs poorly, others may perform better, balancing out potential losses.        </li>
        <li>Asset Allocation: The process of spreading investments among different asset classes (like stocks, bonds, and cash) based on an individual's risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.        </li>
        <li>Dividend: A portion of a company's earnings distributed to its shareholders, typically in cash, as a reward for investing in the company's stock.        </li>
        <li>Index: A benchmark used to measure the performance of a group of securities in a particular market, such as the S&P 500, which tracks the performance of 500 large-cap U.S. stocks.</li>
        <li>Risk: The potential for loss or the variability of returns on an investment. Generally, higher-risk investments have the potential for higher returns, but they also come with a greater chance of loss.        </li>
        <li>Return: The gain or loss of an investment over a certain period, often expressed as a percentage. Positive returns indicate gains, while negative returns indicate losses.        </li>

        <li>Budget Deficit: When your expenses exceed your income, resulting in a shortfall that may need to be covered by borrowing money or dipping into savings.        </li>

        <li>Biweekly vs. Monthly Budgeting: Planning your budget on a biweekly basis (every two weeks) versus a monthly basis can help align your budget with your pay schedule and ensure you're adequately managing your finances throughout the month.        </li>
        <li>Envelope Budgeting: A budgeting method where you allocate cash into physical envelopes for different spending categories, such as groceries, entertainment, and transportation. Once the cash in an envelope is gone, you stop spending in that category until the next budgeting period.        </li>
        <li>Emergency Fund: A savings account set aside to cover unexpected expenses or financial emergencies, such as medical bills, car repairs, or job loss. It's recommended to have three to six months' worth of living expenses saved in an emergency fund.        </li>
        <li>Impulse Spending: Making unplanned purchases on items or services without considering their long-term impact on your budget. Avoiding impulse spending can help you stick to your budget and achieve your financial goals more effectively.        </li>
